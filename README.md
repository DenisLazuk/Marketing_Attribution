## *Observations* ##
1. There are 8 campaigns and 6 sources used by CoolTShirts;
2. There are 4 pairs of campaigns and sources used responsible for first touches;
3. There are 8 pairs of campaigns and sources used responsible for last touches;
4. There are 361 distinct users who made a purchase;
5. The weekly-newsletter and retargetting-ad are responsible most for last touches on the purchase page;
6. CoolTShirts should re-invest in 5 campaigns: interview-with-cool-tshirts-founder, getting-to-know-cool-tshirts, ten-crazy-cool-tshirts-facts as they show best numbers in customers attraction and weekly-newsletter, retargetting-ad because these two show the best last touch effectiveness.
